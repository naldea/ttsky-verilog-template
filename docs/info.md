## How it works
This project was developed as part of the course **IEE2713-1: Digital Systems** at **Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile**, under the guidance of **Prof. Cristian Tejos**. 

It implements a **finite state machine (FSM)** combined with a counter to simulate the operation of a traffic light controller for two perpendicular streets: **Street A** and **Street B**.  

- **Normal mode**: Street A has priority. If cars are detected on Street A (sensor TA), its light stays green. When there are no more cars, Street A changes to yellow for a fixed time, then to red, allowing Street B to turn green. The cycle then repeats with Street B.  
- **Parade mode (P)**: When the button *P* is pressed, Street B stays green indefinitely, regardless of sensors.  
- **Exit parade mode (R)**: Pressing *R* exits parade mode, and the system returns to normal operation.  
- A synchronous **counter** is used to generate the fixed timing for the yellow phases.  

The FSM starts from Street A in green after reset.  


## How to test


1. Provide a clock signal to the module (`clk`) and assert reset (`rst_n = 0 → 1`).  
2. Use the input pins to simulate the presence of cars and mode changes:  
   - `ui_in[0]` → TA (car sensor Street A)  
   - `ui_in[1]` → TB (car sensor Street B)  
   - `ui_in[2]` → P (parade mode button)  
   - `ui_in[3]` → R (reset parade mode button)  
3. Observe the outputs:  
   - `uo_out[1:0]` → LA (traffic light Street A: 00=Red, 01=Yellow, 10=Green)  
   - `uo_out[3:2]` → LB (traffic light Street B: 00=Red, 01=Yellow, 10=Green)  
   - `uo_out[4]`   → `on` (counter finished flag, active during yellow phase).  

You can run the simulation using **cocotb** and `make SIM=icarus` or test directly on FPGA with buttons and LEDs.

## External hardware

- **6 LEDs** to display the two traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green for each street).  
- **5 push-buttons**:  
  - 1 for TA (Street A sensor)  
  - 1 for TB (Street B sensor)  
  - 1 for P (activate parade mode)  
  - 1 for R (exit parade mode)  
  - 1 for Reset
